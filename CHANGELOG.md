# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Changed (Breaking Changes)
- **Secure Handshake Hardening (Gap 1)**: The client now automatically extracts the post-optimized file size, MIME type, and target directory, transmitting them as headers (`x-picha-max-size`, `x-picha-allowed-types`, `x-picha-directory`) during signing and upload requests to prevent parameter tampering and directory hijacking.

## 0.1.6

### Added
- Configured Svelte package to compile styles inline (`emitCss: false`) for zero-config bundler usage.
- Exposed package `exports` mapping for `./style.css` stylesheet path.

## 0.1.5

### Improved
- Enhanced component UI/UX styling with scoped `picha-` CSS classes, dark mode tokens, thumbnail preview filters, and progress percentage badges.
- Added bulk "Remove all files" and single asset deletion actions.
- Aligned `signatureUrl` and `directory` props in `UploadOptions` invocation context.
